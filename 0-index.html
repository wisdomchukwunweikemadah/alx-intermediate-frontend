                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every webpage on the internet. 
                    It provides the structure for content, allowing developers to organize text, images, 
                    links, and other elements in a meaningful way. Without HTML, web browsers would not 
                    know how to display content properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By learning HTML, you gain the ability to build websites, understand how web content 
                    is structured, and even move on to more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript. 
                    HTML is not just for professional developers—it’s a valuable skill for anyone who 
                    wants to create and share content online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, mastering HTML is the first step toward becoming a web developer. 
                    It equips you with the tools to bring ideas to life on the internet.
